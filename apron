#
# A mocking framework for bash. Facilitates creation of an environment where
# external commands can be intercepted and redefined for the purposes of
# testing shell scripts which might involve unwanted side effects.
#
# Note that Apron makes no attempts to catch every possible external call. Any
# call which references a binary directly can easily bypass Apron's "catch-all"
# net unless those external calls are known beforehand and explicitly caught.
#

# This must be the first function called before mocks can be used. This
# performs the rudiementary setup needed to establish the environment, saving
# the PATH variable and defining the command not found handler.

#  -v: Enable verbose output from APRON
